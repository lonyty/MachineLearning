# Group Project in Introduction to Machine Learning

Feeding a supervised machine learning model with financial indicators to predict a hold, sell or buy classification compared to the S&P 500 as a benchmark.

## Additional Information
- Codes were aligned with the chapters in the summary (ex.: for chapter 2, see notebook document "2. Data Cleaning.ipynb")
- Data drawn from kaggle and other ressources were placed in the file "raw_data"
- Our cleaned data set can be located in the file "cleaned_data"

## Overview

The task consists of creating an investment recommendation model, which is able to predict an
annual stock return based on financial indicators from the US Stock market for the period of 2014 to
2018. Our model should be able to indicate the return into a buy/hold/sell classification, which will
be compared with the S&P 500, a stock market index which includes the largest companies listed in
the United States.
Before delving into our data set, we decided to coordinate our approach so we will be able to cover
each of the questions asked step by step. In our initial meeting we quickly realized which milestones
we would be facing during this project. First of all, we noticed a lack of inconsistency in our data set
that we will further elaborate in our first part in our summary. In our second step we outlined which
algorithm will be the most suitable to apply in this project. Here we would measure the performance
for each technique used to make a comparison. We are going to discuss which performance metric
was applied in the corresponding section. Third, we further refine our most accurate model under
the conditions such as varying the number of given features as well as adding new features. Last but
not least, we would conclude our project with highlighting our achievements but also our limitations.
